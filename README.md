# Current Topics and Projects in Social Data Science
[David Garcia](http://dgarcia.eu), 2023

Social Data Science (SDS) provides a broad approach to the quantitative analysis of human behavior through digital trace data. SDS integrates the implementation of data retrieval and processing, the application of statistical analysis methods, and the interpretation of results to derive insights into human behavior at high resolutions and large scales. The motivation for SDS stems from theories in the Social Sciences, which are addressed with respect to societal phenomena and formulated as principles that can be tested against empirical data. Data retrieval in SDS is performed in an automated manner, accessing online resources and programming interfaces that capture the digital traces of human behavior. Data processing is computerized with calibrated methods that quantify human behavior, for example constructing social networks or measuring emotional expression. These quantities are used in statistical analyses to both test hypotheses and explore new aspects of human behavior.

This seminar introduces a set of examples of research projects in Social Data Science as introductory lectures. Students build on those lectures to work on Social Data Science research projects in small groups under the guidance of the lecturer. These projects include the motivation of a research question, the design of a Social Data Science project to assess it, as well as data retrieval and analysis. Students can take the seminar along with the course "Social Media Data Analysis" to apply the methods they learn in the course as part of their projects.

To learn more about the projects to be developed in the course, check the [Projects Guide](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/SDSProjectsSeminar/blob/master/Projects_Guidance/ProjectsGuide.md).

## Prerequisites and evaluation
This seminar is especially indicated for students beyond the first semester of their master studies, especially the SEDS programme.  Participants need to be familiar with programming in R or Python to the level that allows them to perform their own programming (e.g. having passed Introduction to Computation for the Social Sciences). This seminar is recommended to be taken along with the course Social Media Data Analysis.

Students present their group projects in the final seminar sessions and write a report in the shape of a scientific article similar to the ones covered in the seminar. The course grade is based on the presentation (30%) and on the final report (70%).
