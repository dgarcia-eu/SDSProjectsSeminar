# A project-based seminar

The course contains lectures on recent research in Social Data Science and a large practical part to develop a data analysis project under my supervision. The course assessment is based on a project report and a presentation.

Projects are done in groups of two students. Only a group of 3 or 1 is allowed if the course has an odd number of students.

The purpose of the project is to learn by doing in a small data science project including data management, analysis, statistics, and interpretation.

Projects have to start from a research question and have an empirical focus, but at the same time critically reflect on methods, conclusions, and limitations.

#Course calendar

- 13.4: Introduction to the course and research background in SDS
- *20.4: Emotion research with digital traces*
- *27.4: Representation issues with social media data*
- *4.5: Gender inequality in and through digital traces*
- *11.5: Complex privacy issues in digital platforms*
- *25.5: Polarization and politicisation in social media*
- 1.6: Project design feedback session
- **14.6: Registration of projects deadline**
- 15.6, 22.6: Project guidance, discussion, and selected lectures on project-related topics
- **29.6 and 6.7: Project presentations.** We might need to use 29.06 for presentations too if there are too many groups.
- **27.8: Project report deadline**
---

# Project steps

- **1. Form a group and choose a topic**
  - Start now! It's never too soon to think and start readings about a topic
  - You can get input from me via email or around lectures


- **2. Project registration**. Deadline: 14.6
  - Special session to help with registrations on 14.6
  - More guidance sessions before presentations


- **3. Project presentations**. 29.06 and 6.7
  - There is more time to work and improve after the presentations. Results do not have to be final at the presentation, they are updates on your project state


- **4. Submit the final report**. Deadline: 27.8

---
# Pre-registrations as an example

![](aspredicted.png)

---

# Project registrations in this course

- Register your project as a **plain text** email to david.garcia@uni-konstanz.de. 

A project registration is a short text that includes the following:

1. Project title
2. Names and email addresses of group members
3. Research question(s)
4. Planned data retrieval and analysis to address the questions including:
  - precise data sources and parameters or queries if using an API
  - exclusion criteria from retrieved data
  - methods used for all measurement of variables
  - statistical tests and outcomes
  - description of other visualizations or outputs (e.g. models)

---

## Important notes about registrations

.center[![:scale 25%](Warning.svg)]

###**Invest time on designing carefully your project registration!**

Once registered, you cannot change the research questions or project topic. 

You can later adapt steps in the planned data retrieval and analysis, but your final report has to argue why and justify the changes.

---

# Project presentations

- **15-minute** presentations about the state of results of their projects
- Students get questions from the audience regarding the topic and feedback on how to improve the project for the final report.
- Each presentation has to contain four parts:
  1. Research question and motivation
  2. Data and methods
  3. Results
  4. Conclusion and critique
- All members of the group have to participate in their presentation and answer questions.

**After 28.7, no more guidance will be provided email.**

Don't leave your questions for the last minute!

---
# Final report structure (I)

- **Abstract:** 250-word summary of your project including a formulation of its research questions and an overview of methods and results

- **Motivation:** What question(s) do you seek to answer and why? Elaborate on how this research matters in terms of science, technology and/or society

- **Research background:** What previous work is related to this project and what can we learn from it? Do not just cite papers but anything relevant and reflect about the cited contributions on your text

- **Data:** Describe your data sources including descriptive statistics and plots. If you retrieve your own data, carefully document how you generated the data and justify your decision in data retrieval. Carefully document all references to data sources.

---

# Final report structure (II)

- **Methods:** Explain how you filtered data, normalized values, computed additional variables, etc. Detail the statistical analyses and other methods you will apply to asses your research question(s). Carefully document all references to methods and packages used.

- **Results:** Expose the results of your analysis including tables and figures that communicate and illustrate those results

- **Discussion:** Evaluate answers to the question and their reliability. Identify limitations and alternative explanations for your results.

- **Conclusion:** Short summary of the outcome of the project



---

# Submitting the final report

Send a final report as a PDF document (max. 10 pages, min. font size 11pt) via email to david.garcia@uni-konstanz.de.

References do not count towards the page limit. 

Projects can contain a link to a Github repository including the code to produce results, datasets if they can be shared, and additional figures or tables that can be referenced from the project report.

Plots should be correctly shown (named axes, visible scales) and writing has to be understandable. 

A good synthesis is much better than unnecessary information!
---

# Project grading

- 30% for the presentation
- 70% for the final report

Extra points are given when projects are based on open science principles (e.g. data and codes are available in a Github repository).

**Projects do not need to report "positive results",** what is important is that you show how your have addressed your research questions, document any issues or deviations, and critically reflect on methods and results.

---

# Two project paths

### A) Replicating a previous paper
  - Replication has to be critical and based on your own analysis, not the code of others
  - For simple papers, additional analysis beyond replication is expected

### B) Proposing your own idea

None of these paths has a higher expected grade, they are all equally valid.

---

# Project topic examples

- **Bias and fairness in recommender systems**

- **Integrating Survey Data and Digital Trails Data** 

- **Algorithm aversion as expressed on social media data** 

- **Social media polarization**

- **Popularity assortativity of musicians in Spotify**

- **Testing Social Impact Theory in the case of COVID19**

- **Sentiment about Donald Trump and income at the regional level**

More (harder) examples at: https://dgarcia.eu/topics-for-student-projects/

# Some other ideas/pointers

- Algorithms on social media now that the Twitter algorithm is out

- Whatever is happening on TikTok

- Applications of LLM to Social Data Science questions

- The role of Twitter in the fall of Silicon Valley Bank

- Alt-right communities like Voat, Gab, or thedonald.win

- Analysis of parliamentary records (e.g. Germany, US)

- Analysis of historical corpora (e.g. COHA/COCA)

- Generating novel data: e.g. crawling a newspaper and analyzing the data
